## Brief Overview
Match USF is a full-stack web application created to help the IT Senior Project professor match optimal project groups faster.
### The Problem
Group-based courses can often be a major pain for instructors due to having to group students up manually. In a simple course where everyone is doing the same project, instructors could just randomly group students to make their lives easy. Unfortunately when it comes to senior project courses, where each group's project can vary widely, it is very important to group students that are interested in doing the same things.


The instructor can of course put grouping in the hands of the students but that can also be very annoying for the students. In this case, students must advertise themselves (projects they are interested in, availability, etc.) in a discussion post and wait for others to notice and respond. Sometimes these responses can come too late, after the student has already either filled their current group or chose to join another. This can lead to a vicious cycle of constant emailing until the student finally finds an open group matching their needs. Therefore, this type of solution only moves the struggle from the teacher to the students.
### The Solution
In order to make the process of matching students into compatible groups faster and easier on both the students and the teacher, the best thing to do is to try to automate the task as much as possible.
## How Match USF Works
### For Students
Students using Match USF will simply need to fill out and submit a web-form containing their basic information, the top 3 projects they would be interested in working on (from most preferred to least preferred), and what time they are typically available.
### For Instructors
Instructors using Match USF will be able to login, view all the current submitted forms, delete forms, and finally run a create groups function that automatically creates and displays suggested groups of 3 or 4 based on shared project interests and available times.
